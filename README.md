# Scheherazade Scratch

This repo is a clone of [Scheherazade New](https://github.com/silnrsi/font-scheherazade). 

The `master` branch will track the upstream repo as needed, while the `play` branch is used just for play, not for building a production font.

Changes from `master` branch include:

- Builds only Regular weight
- Does not rename glyphs to production names, but keeps working names
- Internally renames the built font to `Scheherazade Scr Regular` so it can be installed beside Scheherazade New if desired. Note, however, that the file name remains "ScheherazadeNew-Regular.ttf"

Additional changes will be in the OpenType code where I'm playing around

Below this line this README.md is unchanged.
